The idea for this project came directly from a Kaggle competition. “The competition is simple: use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.” The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous and tragic events in history. 1,502 of the 2,224 passengers and crew perished in the Titanic’s maiden voyage after hitting an Iceberg in the North Atlantic Ocean. This has led to numerous changes in ship regulations, deep dive explorations, and even a famous James Cameron movie adaptation. Today, Kaggle is running a challenge to build a predictive model to answer the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?’ using passenger data (i.e. name, gender, socio-economic class, etc.).” We answer that question using multiple Machine Learning modeling techniques: Lasso logistic regression, Radial Base Function Kernel Support Vector Machine and three tyes of Decision Trees (Basic Decision Tree, Pruned Decision Tree and Random Forest).

In this project we have the Jupyter Notebook we used to created all the models. We also have the train.csv and test.csv datasets needed to run this model. Lastly, we have the write up on the project explaining what my team and I did to get our final models.

Thank you for your time!
